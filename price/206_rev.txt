I loooove love loveeeeee this mask! Does exactly what it says, anddd totally diggin how smooth my face is the next morning. Definitely worth the purchase. It's like a milky texture and the smell is great! I use it for an hr or sometimes more depending on what I'm doing at the time. You certainly get a little extra more also for those who likes to get their mask worth. I save that extra and put it on in the morning after I cleanse my face and go on with my day!I don’t have a lot of wrinkles, my skin is pretty firm, but I do have some forehead wrinkles that I am trying to target. If you do what the instructions say and stretch this mask taught over your face, pulling upwards, for at least 20 minutes, I think it really does work to smooth out wrinkles, somehow, it does seem to contour and its very moisturizing. But you have to stretch the mask over your skin and pull it tight!! I wasn’t even really expecting anything from this mask, but honestly think this mask really works. It’s actually quite amazing. My skin was really smoothed out after I used it. Use it before a big night out!! I am 28 and don’t have many wrinkles, but it would probably work even better if you have saggy skin. I am sure you would see a difference. It’s an awesome mask.I have no problem spending a lot of money on great products. But, I've used this mask multiple times and have noticed no difference. I've even left it on over night to make sure I had given it enough of a chance. Not only did I not notice a difference, but my skin was actually a bit dried out the next day. I'll use them up as hopefully they're doing some good, but definitely won't purchase again.I love this mask. I was literally stunned when I saw my face the morning after I used it. Left it on until I fell asleep then it came off at some point during the night. Vey relaxing and very effective.I am no stranger to top of the line skin care. Most of what I use comes from my dermatologist...Obagi, Neo-Cutis and Revale products. I was reading so many things about SK-II, I decided to try this mask. In the relatively short time you have it on, it definitely makes your skin look healthy with a wonderful glow. I especially love the upper/lower face design on this version.Had one the most important meetings of my life, and was ill with the flu. With the help of some Bikram Yoga, lots of water, and this miracle mask... i was back on top. My skin was luminous! As if I was coming from the spa! BUY IT!!!!
