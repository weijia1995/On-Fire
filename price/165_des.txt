Inspired by the traditions of noble Venetian perfumery, Colonia Ambra introduces amber to Acqua di Parma's first fragrance, Colonia. Created in 1916 in the City of Parma and used by Italian tailors to lend a delicate scent to the fabric of their custom creations, Colonia was also used by gentlemen to scent their handkerchiefs. It first achieved international success in the late 1930s when Hollywood's silver screen legends discovered it during their travels to Italy

Ambergris, a redolent addition introduced to luxury European fragrances when it was brought back by Marco Polo in the 13th century, remains one of the world’s most expensive fragrance ingredients, and one of the least known.
