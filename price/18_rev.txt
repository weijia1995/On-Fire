I bought this in hopes that it could replace both my cleanser and moisturizer. (I guess I was looking for something like micellar water) It is not the best at removing eye make up. I used make up remover wipes on my eyes before using this and even still it could not get everything off... It also says that you don't have to wash it off, so the first time I used it I followed the directions. At first it feels very sticky on my face but as it dried that went away. I had a glow at first to my skin but later on in the day it looked more like shine from oil... so I usually rinse it off now after I use it, which the whole point of me buying this was to avoid using harsh water on my face. However, it does moisturize very well. I have very dry, flaky skin in the winter and usually have to moisturize twice a day. Since using this I have not touched my moisturizer once. It also appears very gentle on my skin and has not caused it to break out so far from what I can see. I probably will not buy this again in the future however.I was hopeful that this would be the makeup remover that would take all of my mascara, but ended with disappointment. Yes, it removes a majority of my makeup then again so does my drug store bought remover. I still have to use this this product multiple times to remove majority of my eye makeup followed by a round of my Peter Thomas cleanser. Even then I sometimes have to use this again to remove the last bit of mascara. I've only used a handful of days and already it is half gone.This has become a staple in my nighttime skincare routine! This has completely REPLACED MY CLEANSER! I use this to remove makeup and clean the skin. It gets EVERYTHING off my face effortlessly. It's so gentle on my sensitive skin while really getting the makeup, dirt, and oils off of the surface of my skin. I wish this made this in a bigger bottle, almost used it for a month and I'm nearly halfway done with the bottle.
