 PMD Personal Microderm PRO BLUE Exclusive is an exfoliating tool that reveals soft, polished skin from head to toe. A customizable range of exfoliation disks, made with the same aluminum oxide crystals used by professionals, buffs away dead, dull-looking skin cells from the face and body to allow newer, younger-looking cells to grow in their place. The professional-grade technology delivers allover radiance, a reduction in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, blemishes, and enlarged pores, and creates an even tone and texturewithout the hassle or high price of in-office visits. Featuring patented spinning-disc technology and a perfectly calibrated vacuum suction that pulls blood flow to the surface, the dramatic results include exfoliation and increased circulation. With dual-speed settings for sensitive skin and the ultimate comfort experience, makeup applies smoother and skin care products absorb up to 20 times better for glowing skin.
