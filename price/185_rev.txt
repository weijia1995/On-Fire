Would NOT recommend this for the money. It is super expensive and it is noooothing special at all. And if anything made things worse for my skin. I got little whiteheads everywhere.Love this moisturizer it's light and doesn't clog my pores, my only complaint is if you're lazy like me and don't wash your face in the morning you can look a little shiny. (Combination/sensitive skin)I purchased this with the entire 3-step program. While this feels amazing (it's very light and feels like it would make your skin really moisturized), it stings a bit when I put it on after scrubbing and cleansing, and doesn't keep my skin moisturized. I have normally combination/oily skin so was not impressed--especially with the price point.This smells and feels like gold. I had the clearest skin when i used this. It ran out quickly but its worth the priceThis stuff is great. You need to use the whole line for it to work properly. Amazing resultsThis stuff is great.
