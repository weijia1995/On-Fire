This is a sleek, sturdy, and eye catching stand. I bought it to hold my husband's new single blade razor that I purchased for him at The Art of Shaving store, along with the boars hair brush that came in the travel size kit. It fits both the razor and brush beautifully. I'm not sure why others have said the brushes don't fit...works just fine with any size brush. The stand fits around the narrowest part of the hairs, with the top of the handle against the stand. I think others were trying to jam the handle into the stand.It's pricey, but it's something that is used daily and it's always out on the counter. I paid to have nice dispensers and trays too though so this just adds to the beauty in our bathroom.The metal is virtually scratch-proof, doesn't show fingerprints easily, and is so heavy that it's nearly impossible to knock it over. It looks very classy.Definitely worth the money if your husband lathers and uses a nice razor, and if you want to add more style and order to your bathroom.Just to note, this brand makes multiple sizes of shaving brushes. There are full-size brushes, and there are travel kit brushes that are smaller and easier to travel with or give as gifts. This particular brush stand is for full-size brushes and not the travel ones.
 A sales associate told me that just like makeup brushes, shaving brushes have to be dried preferably upside down so as not to damage the glue holding the bristles together. While this stand is rather expensive, it looks great on the bathroom counter or vanity and fulfills its purpose. Personally, I gave it as a gift, and it was very well received.I bought this for my boyfriend because I got him an Art of Shaving kit last Christmas. It was supposed to be the final touch to his shaving tools, but the brush didn't fit in the holder! How can a brush by the same manufacturer not fit? I had to return it and get the Classic shaving stand, which did work. He has the black handle boar brush so if you have that, don't buy this stand.This is a sleek, sturdy, and eye catching stand.
