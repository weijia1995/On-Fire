What it is:
 A fluffy, natural-hair face brush for effortlessly diffusing powder products.

What it does:
 This face brush easily distributes and blends powder products (bronzers, blushes, highlighters, setting powder) with whisper-soft strokes. Surratt Beauty is committed to the Japanese philosophy of monozukuri; each high-quality brush is crafted from hand-tied natural fibers by a skilled artisan.

What else you need to know:
 The Surratt Beauty line of ergonomic brushes is designed to do most of the work for you. During the first few uses, some natural hair shedding is normal and should be expected. To maintain the integrity of your brush, wash with gentle shampoo at least once a month. Reshape the natural hairs and lay flat on a towel to dry.
"Always finish with a touch of translucent powder. It helps to set makeup, bonding it to the skin and giving a longer-wearing result."Troy SurrattWhat it is:
