Directions followed. Applied "liberally" this $140 product. Nothing. Repeat again another day. Nothing. 
 Nor did it absorb. It emulsifies slightly for a minute, then dries on your face in a way which seems as though you picked a fight with a pile of glazed donuts and lost.
 One for the return pile. Love the polish and sheet masks though.Pros - creamy texture, non-irritating fragrance 
 Cons - expensive, very irritating for my skin - when I woke up, my face was bright red. The redness did subside on the third day, and my skin WAS smooth and clear. 
 Maybe for some it would create a "rosy glow", but on my sensitive skin, it looked more like a "tropical suburn" .I'm currently on Accutane searching for hydrating products to soothe, calm and quench the flaking thirst of my skin. My daily face products are: La Mer line and occasional lancer skin exfoliate/cleanser. 
 This definitely is hydrating and i feel as though I have a luminous glow when I wake. I apply it to a clean face at bedtime. 
 I took away one star as it seems to clump at times and flake from my skin. But, that could be the flaking dead skin due to the Accutane.Directions followed. Applied "liberally" this $140 product. Nothing. Repeat again another day. Nothing.
