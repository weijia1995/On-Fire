Don't let the price fool you. This manicure set is really nothing special. I bought it for my husband and did not tell him the price, wanting to see if he liked any of the tools or the leather pouch particularly better than the basic ones he already had. That was a few months ago and he has used every piece but also goes back and forth using his basic tools. The tools are sturdy and the leather pouch is fine, but I don't really see a value in this set that warrants the high price. I give it three stars ONLY because the value does not match the price. The quality is fine and if it were $60 I would highly recommend the product and give it 5 starsLove it!!!! The real leather pouch is holding up.Turned my nails into goldThis is a good set, but I could go to the dollar store and buy something exactly the same and not over priced. C'mon?! 160$, that's over overpriced! It's ridiculous.Don't let the price fool you. This manicure set is really nothing special.
