I never write reviews, but I feel like I had todincr no one else has commented. 
 First of all I couldn't find anywhere on the website if it's unisex, male or female product. It does have beautiful smell typical of the Blue line, little bit masculine, but very subtle. I do own their several Eue de Toilette and love the smell.  The problem I had with it, is that it's advertised as a moisturizer. It's not a cream lotion. It's a tonic like lotion (liquid). I put it on my face and immediately my skin felt tighter, smoother, and still dry as it were before the application. 
 I will be returning it.
