Nice product but if you have thick hair 2-3 pumps of this will feel like nothing. Squeeze the water out of hair well to feel the product spread nicely then use 2 more pumps. This product is a big investment on a monthly basis but it works! Your hair will feel great by the second use ! And it smells nice so i will repurchase! To have this last longer use the deep conditioner alongside (Like about 1/2 a teaspoon-1 tablespoon of it if you have thick hair so that the product can last more than a month) p.s i purchased the repair shampoo conditioner; repair masque; hair oil; leave in conditioner; and thickening lotion & if you want the product without breaking the bank too much just get the shampoo conditioner, deep conditioner/masque, and hair oil.
