I bought the Philtre Ceylon cologne over the weekend and have worn it twice. This is definitely going back. On the tester strips, it is a light scent that smells most strongly of tea. On me, it's heavy, lasts forever (which is generally a good thing, but not if you don't like it!), and it's not as much tea as it is something else that I can't identify. I definitely recommend spraying some on yourself and giving it some time for this one. Also, as a female who generally likes wearing scents meant for men, this one is too masculine to get away with.
