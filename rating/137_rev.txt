I have the fair to light highlighter. I'm very fair with cool undertones for reference. If I apply too much it will come out more yellow, but it blends out wonderfully. It is good for everyday/casual makeup looks. It is more subtle and I don't recommend it for a super glam look. Overall I'm very happy with the color pay off and how goof proof it is!Super duper chalky and color payoff is horrific!!! How hard is it to get a simple highlighter on point? You are better off highlighting you face with bread flour than this mess!!!!I have the fair to light highlighter. I'm very fair with cool undertones for reference.
